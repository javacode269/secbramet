- Just speak the sentences based on your intuition that sound correct. 
	If you spend too much time analyzing structures, phrases, words, etc., 
	you won't be able to speak fluently.
- Don't worry about what others think of you. 
	Instead, focus on practicing to pronounce words correctly as much as possible.
- You should have motivation to learn English and maintain it every day. 
	For example, learning English just for fun, watching American films without subtitles, 
	and being able to communicate comfortably with native speakers.
