Kerberos:
	is an authentication protocol
	Put the problem:
		usually, using password to prove your identity
		weakness of using password is easy being eavesdrop
		need a means to authentication users to use any service anytime 
	Kerberos have 2 purpuses:
		authentication
		security
	3 component join:
		client 
		KDC(Key distributed center)
			2 server:
				Authentication server (AS)
				Ticket granting server (TGS)
		server
	How it work:
		client have id 
		id - password was save in database
		password is sharekey
		password is key to encrypt (in  side client)
		password is key to descrypt (in  side server)
		AS send privateKeyX_encrypt(TGT) to client
		client send privateKeyX_encrypt(TGT) to TGS
		TGS will descrypt (privateKeyX_encrypt(TGT)), send back encrypt_keyFileServer(token) to client
		keyFileServer is share key of TGS with FileServer
		client send request with token to FileServer
