=============================
NTP: 
	stand for network time protocol
	NTP also is the client-server programs
How does NTP work?	
	1. NTP client initiates a time-request exchange with the NTP server
	2. The client is then able to calculate the link delay and its local offset and adjust its local clock to match the clock at the server's computer
	3. As a rule, SIX message exchanges over a period of about FIVE to 10 minutes are required to initially set the clock.
		when synchronized, the client updates every 10 min (only need ONE message exchange)
Port for communication:
	Port: 123 on server side
What are NTP features?
	Specialized receivers: la nhung bo tinh toan thoi gian chuyen biet

	NTP uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to synchronize computer clock times
What are stratum levels
	There are 4 strata:
		Stratum 0
		Stratum 1
		Stratum 2
		Stratum 3
2 important definition 
	RTC = Real Time Clock
		is the device in your computer that keeps track of time even when the computer is turned off & unplugged. That's the reason for the CMOS battery in your system - - to keep the clock running, and to save certain BIOs settings.
		==> RTC show Greenwich Mean Time 
	UTC = Universal Time Coordinated
How to check RTC, UTC, Location time:
	run command: "timedatectl"
window and linux RTC:
	Both Linux and Windows use the RTC. The difference is that Linux sets the RTC to universal time (UTC) and Windows sets it to local time (LT).
LT: local time
Daylight saving time:
	Quy ước giờ mùa hè hay giờ tiết kiệm ánh sáng ban ngày (DST) là quy ước chỉnh đồng hồ tăng thêm một khoảng thời gian (thường là 1 giờ) so với giờ tiêu chuẩn 
Comparition between fail server:
	Correct server:
	[root@billdatanode143 vt_admin]# hwclock -r
		Wed 20 Sep 2023 10:42:05 PM ICT  -0.189965 seconds
	wrong server:
	[root@billdatanode146 vt_admin]# hwclock -r
		Wed 20 Sep 2023 10:42:05 PM +07  -0.394072 seconds
		
fix : 
	unlink /etc/localtime
	ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh /etc/localtime
Why?
	why we need to create link and not just to copy the file
	from /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC to /etc/localtime as:
		cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC /etc/localtime
	Explain:
		Your /etc/localtime won't be updated when timezone files are updated (this happens every few years, typically when some countries change their DST regulations). Linking makes sure it stays up to date.
