	What Is LDAP?
		+ LDAP là một protocol dùng cho việc "accessing and maintaining authentication information"
		+ LDAP can also tackle authentication, so users can sign on just once and access many different files on the server.(verify 1 lần và truy cập nhiều tài nguyên khác nhau)
	How LDAP work?
		Two methods LDAP authenticate the user:
			+ SIMPLE: The correct name and password connect the user to the server. 
			+ SIMPLE AUTHENTICATION AND SECURITY LAYER (SASL). A secondary service, such as Kerberos, performs authentication before the user can connect. For companies that require advanced security, this can be a good option.
		LDAP query:
		+ Session connection. The user connects to the server via an LDAP port. 
		+ Request. The user submits a query, such as an email lookup, to the server. 
		+ Response. The LDAP protocol queries the directory, finds the information, and delivers it to the user. 
		+ Completion. The user disconnects from the LDAP port.
	Operations with LDAP:
		+ Add. Enter a new file into the database. 
		+ Delete. Take out a file from the database. 
		+ Search. Start a query to find something within the database. 
		+ Compare. Examine two files for similarities or differences. 
		+ Modify. Make a change to an existing entry.
 	LDAP Terms to Understand

		+ Distinguished name
