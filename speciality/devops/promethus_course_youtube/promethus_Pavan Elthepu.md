## Observability vs. Monitoring


Tool help us to track the health of invidual component include: database, network, infra-structure

To monitoring effectively we need to know:

4 golden signal:
- latency: time to take for requests to travel from the client to server and back
- traffic: number of requests system receive over specific period
- errors: percentage of requests resulting in errors, such as 404 Page not found or 500  internal server Error
- saturation: Measure resource utilization, including CPU, mem, disk space.

3 pillars of Observability:
- Logs: Provide a chronological record of events, transactions within a system
- Traces: Help track the flow of requests through various services and component of a service.
- Metrics: Quantitative measurements that offer a snapshot of a system's performance overtime.
