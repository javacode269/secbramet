Kerberos:
	is an authentication protocol
	Put the problem:
		usually, using password to prove your identity
		weakness of using password is easy being eavesdrop
		need a means to authentication users to use any service anytime 
	Kerberos have 2 purpuses:
		authentication
		security
	3 component join:
		client 
		KDC(Key distributed center)
			2 server:
				Authentication server (AS)
				Ticket granting server (TGS)
		server
	How it work:
		client have id 
		id - password was save in database
		password is sharekey
		password is key to encrypt (in  side client)
		password is key to descrypt (in  side server)
		AS send privateKeyX_encrypt(TGT) to client
		client send privateKeyX_encrypt(TGT) to TGS
		TGS will descrypt (privateKeyX_encrypt(TGT)), send back encrypt_keyFileServer(token) to client
		keyFileServer is share key of TGS with FileServer
		client send request with token to FileServer

	important definition:
		Kerberos principal:
			unique identity which kerberos can assign ticket to
			principal can be a user or a service
			sample:
				user@realm: joe@EXAMPLE.COM
				service@realm: hdfs@EXAMPLE.COM
				user/host@realm: joe/node1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
		KEYTAB
			Every principal need a password to login to Kerberos
			all Hadoop service like hdfs, yarn.. also need a principal, but they don't have password(because they aren't not user)
			=> a way to store the "password" in a file (so-called KEYTAB)
			KEYTAB save a unique key that can be used by services to authenticate themselves with Kerberos
			On the Linux system, when a service has read access this keytab, it can authenticate using its principal name (service name) 
			and the keytab as a password

	Demo:
		Existing MIT KDC:
			Checklist:
				Ambari Server and cluster hosts have network access to both the KDC and KDC admin hosts.
				KDC administrative credentials are on-hand.
				The Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) have been setup on the Ambari Server host and all hosts in the cluster.
